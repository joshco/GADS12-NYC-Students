    "message": "FACTUAL COMPARISON OF CIVIC TALENT... written by Spanish journalist Sebastian Vivar Rodriguez, Barcelona (Spain). Recipient of the International Prize in Literature. \n============= \n\nWalking along the “Rambla del Raval” (Barcelona) I saw it clearly: Europe died in Auschwitz. We killed 6 million Jews, and we end up importing 20 million Muslims. \n\nWhy is not possible to generalize? Well, seeing as how we did things, I think that it is possible to generalize.  Surely, we would have exceptions?  Ok ... but those are exceptions! \n\nFor the rest, in general it must be said that at Auschwitz we burned a culture, the intelligence and ability to create wealth; we burned the people of this world who proclaim to be God's chosen. Because it is the Jewish people .... whom ... have provided humanity the greatest minds, those capable of changing the course of history (such as Christ, Marx, Einstein, Freud), and great moments of progress and well-being! \n\nAnd it must also be said that the result of relaxing boundaries, and of cultural relativism, and values under the absurd pretext of tolerance, have caused the arrival of 20 million Muslims, often illiterate and fanatic, whom Europe has allowed to come in and -at best-  are as I said, in this “Rambla del Raval” the maximum expression of the third world, of the ghetto, and -in the worst case scenario- are prepared to attack us (as they did in Manhattan or Madrid) as consequence of the official protection we offer them day in and day out. \n\n° We have changed culture with fanaticism, the capacity to create wealth with the will to destroy it, intelligence with superstition. \n\n° We have changed the instinct of overcoming all obstacles that the Jews have (who in the worst conditions imaginable have never tired of wanting a peaceful and better world), with the suicidal instinct of Leganés [journalist is referring to the Islamic terror bombings in Leganés Train Station, Madrid, in 2004].\n\n° We have changed the diamonds (as \"portable wealth\" for the next time Jews have to flee), with the Palestinian stones which are always against any attempt at peace. \n\n° We have changed the pride to survive and excel, with the fanatical obsession with death, and –incidentally- killing us all, including our children. \n===== \n\n* The Global Islamic population is approximately 1,200,000,000; that is ONE BILLION TWO HUNDRED MILLION or 20% of the world's population. They have received the following Nobel Prizes: \n\nLiterature: \n1988 - Najib Mahfooz \n\nPeace: \n1978 - Mohamed Anwar El-Sadat \n1990 - Elias James Corey \n1994 - Yasser Arafat: \n1999 - Ahmed Zewai \n\nEconomy: \n(zero) \n\nPhysics: \n(zero) \n\nMedicine: \n1960 - Peter Brian Medawar \n1998 - Ferid Mourad \n\nTOTAL:  SEVEN (7) NOBEL PRIZES \n===== \n\n* The Global Jewish population is approximately 14,000,000; that is FOURTEEN MILLION or about 0.02% of the population of the world.

Not even a single Jew has ever been accused of destroying a church, synagogue or mosque. \n\nNot a single Jew has protested by killing people. The Jews do not traffic slaves, nor have leaders calling for Jihad to kill all infidels.\n\nPerhaps Muslims should consider investing in educating its people and not on blaming the Jews for all their problems. \n\nThe Muslims must ask themselves what they could do for mankind, rather than first demanding that humanity respect them, regardless. \n\nWhatever you opinion about the crisis between Israel and its Palestinian and Arab neighbors, even if you think Israel is the culprit, the following sentence really says it all: \"If the Arabs were to put down their weapons today, there would be no more violence. If the Jews were to put down their weapons today, there would be no more Israel “ -Benjamin Netanyahu. \n\nIt is on the record that the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, General Dwight Eisenhower, when entering the Nazi concentration camps, he saw the victims of the death camps, and immediately he ordered all possible photographs to be taken, all due investigations, all available information and documents from all the Germans in the surrounding villages to whom they asked to give burial to the dead, and –in the process- to inform of any evidence or clue to lead to more data about the Holocaust. \n\nEisenhower said in his own words: \"Make sure everything is in the files, get all films, get all witnesses, ... because somewhere down the road of history some bastard will get up and say that this never happened.\" \n\nRecently, the Parliament of the United Kingdom considered removing the Holocaust curriculum from schools, because \"offended\" the Muslim population which claims that the Holocaust never happened.  Now, 60 years after Second World War, this e-mail is being sent as a memorial chain, in honor of those 6 million Jews, 20 million Russians, 10 million Christians, and 1,900 Catholic priests who  \"were murdered, raped, burned, starved, beaten, humiliated and exterminated. \"\n\nNow, more than ever, with Iran -among others- claiming the Holocaust is a \"myth\", it is imperative to make sure the world never forgets.  How many years will pass before someone says that the attack on the World Trade Center 'NEVER HAPPENED'?  ... because it offends Muslims. \n\nI get the chills when imagining a world dominated by zealots! \n\nThis article of the Spanish journalist \n°° Sebastian Vivar Rodriguez \nwas translated and brought to you by \n°° John Xuna,\nAmerican / Spanish Engineer, Physicist, Atheist Writer (\"The Ignorance of Faith\")",

My own personal views are that this really should be a NON-ISSUE in each and every state.  There is NO VALID REASON that anyone has been able to give me to date as to why gay and straight people should not have the exact same rights.   I tell people right upfront that I want an  honest to God, real and valid reason.  Not an  excuse and not some Bible-pounding, personal interpetation that suits them.   Each state seems to  be hell-bent on taking this up with higher courts.  WHY I ask the powers that be?   Funny, I NEVER get a direct, valid answer.  All I get are simple-minded excuses.   My next question is, \"when did you make a personal choice to be straight?\"     Once again, no VALID responses.  Most simply give me a dead stare and say,  \"well, that's different.\"       HOW and WHY is this  different I asked?    Some finally give up and say, \" I see what you mean now.\"    Others just change the subject quickly.     LOVE KNOWS NO BOUNDERIES.   Love does not  pick and choose where it will land and EVERY human being  has the right to  be happy with the person he/she loves and have the exact same equal rights and marital rights that I have....PERIOD!   Eventually, same-sex marriage will be legal in every state and equal rights will prevail as it should have already.   Why spend all of that money on what is  inevitable?     \nI'm  quite an impatient old lady of 67 years, very straight , very married  and have 9 grandkids and I will keep fighting this fight until something so wrong is made right.",

To begin with, if you cannot form a coherent, intelligent sentence, you should probably keep your comments to yourself.\n\nTo those of you who are opposed to gay marriage, or homosexuality in general, based on religious principles, that's fine.  You can feel however you want, our Constitution gives you that right.  The Constitution is the law of the land, not the Bible.\n\nOn that note, while the people of North Carolina voted for Amendment One, it is up to the Federal courts to decide whether or not that amendment violates the United States Constitution or federal law.  I don't know if you remember this whole Civil War thing, but states cannot pass laws that violate the Constitution or federal law.  Federal courts, including the circuit that has jurisdiction over North Carolina, have consistently found that laws or constitutional amendments that define marriage as that between a man and a woman violate the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act.\n\nLet me educate you on the Fourteenth Amendment.  It guarantees ALL Americans equal protection under the law.  What that means is that we cannot pass laws that give certain legal rights to one class of individuals while denying those same rights to another class.  Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is also prohibited by the Civil Rights Act as amended in 1991.\n\nThe gist of things here is that a) it is illegal, as the courts have found, to deny the rights of marriage to anyone, b)laws or amendments that perform this function violate the Constitution and are thus void.\n\nI could care less if you think being gay goes against the Bible.  If you don't like homosexuals, don't be friends with them (they probably don't like you anyways).  Have a problem with homosexuals raising children?  There are numerous gay couples in my church that have adopted children.  Yes, that's right, my CHURCH.  Many of these children have been adopted from heterosexual couples who either don't want them or do not have the means or compassion to do so.  So these people step up and raise the kids that us heterosexual married couples don't want and they're bad people?  Do you even know any gay people?  Probably not.  \n\nGay marriage doesn't affect you, so go hate your life and private and let these damn people get married.",
